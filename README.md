# Python_Tkinter_Project_Information_Ledger
This application is meant to emulate the workings of a database used to store user entered information. This project allowed me to learn SQLite and Tkinter fundamentals 
while refresh my skills on python object oriented programming. 

Here is everything I learnt while developing this project:
- Tkinter basics (creating root window, labels, buttons, and adding functionality to buttons)
- Database storage (Created a database; created a table within the database; stored data in the table; accessed each record in table)
- Added functionality to buttons using python methods and global variables
- Learnt how to delete, edit, and update data in the table using GUI based tools and widgets via tkinter
- Display the table's data in a user friendly manner
